## Introduction to SQL (Course 1)
This is the documentation for the "Introduction to SQL" course I completed as part of the [Associate Data Analyst in SQL Career Track](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/associate-data-analyst-in-sql) on DataCamp.

### Course Overview
In this course, I learned the foundational concepts of SQL, including how to query relational databases, retrieve data, and understand database structures. These are critical skills for working with structured data and performing data analysis tasks.

### Key Concepts Covered
#### 1. Understanding Databases:
- What is a database?
- Introduction to relational databases.
- Working with tables, fields, and records.
- Learning different data types (e.g., VARCHAR, INT, NUMERIC).
#### 2. Basic SQL Syntax:
How to use basic SQL commands such as:
- SELECT – for retrieving data.
- FROM – specifying the source table.
- DISTINCT – removing duplicates.
- AS – renaming columns for readability.
#### 3. SQL in Action: 
Throughout the course, I worked with a Books dataset and applied various SQL concepts. 
For example:
```SQL
SELECT title, author 
FROM books 
WHERE year = 2010;
```
This query retrieves the title and author of books published in the year 2010.
#### 4. Practical Application: 
The course also introduced me to how relational databases are structured and how SQL can be used in real-world applications for retrieving and analyzing data.

### Hands-on Projects
You can check my hands-on work and detailed analysis on DataCamp’s DataLab by visiting my [SQL Learning Journal: Associate Data Analyst Track (Course 1 - Introduction to SQL)](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/8eea17d0-f268-4b07-964e-39caee9f43fb/edit).
Here you’ll find queries I worked on, analysis of the Books dataset, and more interactive examples that show SQL in practice.

### How to Use This Repository:
This repository will serve as a documentation and portfolio of my SQL learning journey. Each course will be documented with:
- Key SQL Concepts covered in each lesson.
- Sample Queries that I wrote and used.
- Real-World Applications demonstrating how these skills can be used in a work setting.
- Links to my interactive DataLab projects for deeper exploration.
